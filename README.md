# What linux distro should i use?

 I made a super simple Linux distribution finder quiz that any beginner can use! 🐧 

 The point of this quiz is to give beginners a Linux distro that feels familiar to what they are currently using,
 and one that can run easly on their hardware. So they can "wet their feet" with Linux, so to speak.

 That is why it uses simple language and simple questions, Linux is not only for the hardcore tech fans.
